# Community Project Requirements

This document outlines the requirements for the APCSA Community Project. Your class must meet all of the following criteria to receive full credit.

## Rubric

| # | Criteria | Points |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | Contains at least 3 instance variables for the class | 3 |
| 2 | At least one constructor with at least 3 parameters to set all of the instance variables to the given parameters | 3 |
| 3 | `print()` method that uses `System.out.println` to print out all the instance variables | 3 |
| 4 | Accessor (get) methods for each of the instance variables (at least 3) | 3 |
| 5 | Mutator (set) methods for each of the instance variables (at least 3) | 3 |
| 6 | `toString()` method that returns all the information in the instance variables | 3 |
| 7 | Additional method for your class that takes a parameter | 2 |
| 8 | Main method (or separate class) that constructs at least 2 objects of your class using the constructor and then calls all of the methods that you created above to test them and print out the results | 10 |
| **Total** | | **30** |

## Detailed Requirements

### R#1: Instance Variables (3 points)
Your class must contain **at least 3 instance variables** that represent key attributes of your class.

### R#2: Constructor (3 points)
Implement **at least one constructor** with **at least 3 parameters** that initializes all instance variables to the given parameter values.

### R#3: Print Method (3 points)
Create a `print()` method that uses `System.out.println()` to display all instance variables.

### R#4: Accessor Methods (3 points)
Implement getter methods (accessor methods) for **each instance variable** (minimum 3 getters).

### R#5: Mutator Methods (3 points)
Implement setter methods (mutator methods) for **each instance variable** (minimum 3 setters).

### R#6: toString() Method (3 points)
Override the `toString()` method to return a `String` containing all information from the instance variables.

### R#7: Additional Method (2 points)
Create **one additional method** for your class that **takes at least one parameter** and performs some meaningful operation.

### R#8: Testing in Main (10 points)
Create a `main()` method (or separate test class) that:
- Constructs **at least 2 objects** of your class using the constructor
- Calls **all methods** you created (print(), getters, setters, toString(), and the additional method)
- Prints out the results to demonstrate that all methods work correctly

## Notes
- Choose a meaningful topic for your class that relates to your community or interests
- Test your code thoroughly to ensure all methods work as expected
- Follow Java naming conventions and style guidelines
- Include meaningful variable names and code comments where appropriate
